                    <h3>Meet Jon Nelson, who has a brain implant</h3>
                    <p>On a hot, sunny Sunday afternoon in Manhattan, time froze for Jon Nelson. He stood on the
                        sidewalk and said good-bye to his three kids, whose grandfather had come into the city from
                        Long
                        Island to pick them up. Like any parent, Jon is deeply attuned to his children’s quirks. His
                        oldest? Sometimes quiet but bitingly funny. His middle kid? Rates dad a 10 out of 10 on the
                        embarrassment scale and doesn’t need a hug. His 10-year-old son, the baby of the family, is
                        the
                        emotional one. “My youngest son would climb back up into my wife’s womb if he could,” Jon
                        says.
                        “He’s that kid.”</p>

                        I am a medical marketing professional who suffers from mental illness. I am also a survivor of
                        mental illness. Those are difficult words for me to say within my work world. They have been
                        kept
                        quiet from the majority of my colleagues for the past 15 years. Opening up in this way is
                        difficult,
                        vulnerable and scary — but it’s also my reality. It’s my truth.

                    <h3>Depression almost killed me. It’s time to strip the shame from mental illness.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The majority of society is ignorant when it comes to mental illness. That ignorance keeps those
                        suffering silent. I don’t want to stay silent anymore. I lived with depression. I tried every
                        treatment I could get my hands on — more than 10 medications, constant therapy, residential
                        treatment facilities, intensive outpatient programs, ketamine, cannabis, transcranial magnetic
                        stimulation, and electroconvulsive (shock) therapy.

                    <h3>Meet Jon Nelson, who has a brain implant</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jon Nelson’s depression was poison. “I had poison in every single bit of my body. It literally
                        ran
                        throughout every cell in my body. My blood carried the poison, and it crushed everything in
                        me.”
                        <br>
                        Melancholia, one of depression’s early names, comes from the ancient Greek word for “black
                        bile,” a
                        diseased liquid believed to flood a body. It was once thought that bloodletting and other ways
                        to
                        let the corrupting fluids out could ease people’s minds.
