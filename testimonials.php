                                Humans come into your life for a reason. Jon has taught me the importance of mental
                                health, something we ALL take for granted. And the importance of just BEING THERE for
                                someone. Don’t have to talk—just hold their hands and remind them that they matter more
                                than they’ll ever know.

                                Jon was instrumental in successfully advocating for BRAIN Initiative funding during the
                                recent Congressional Neuroscience Caucus Briefing on Capitol Hill. It’s crucial for
                                Congress to hear directly from those affected by brain-related diseases to fully grasp
                                the implications of their legislative decisions on their constituents. Jon’s sincere and
                                compelling message left a lasting impression on Members of Congress and their staff,
                                ensuring that the importance of BRAIN Initiative funding remains at the forefront of
                                their discussions and considerations moving forward.

                                As the CEO of a mental health startup I was a bit nervous about bringing a person with
                                lived experience into the chaos of building a startup. From our first meeting, I was
                                convinced it was the right move. Jonhas been like a member of the team helping us build
                                this company. In addition to his intimate understanding of the disease and the patient
                                journey, he also understands the realities of building a business, and telling a story.
                                He has such a compelling way of telling his story and helping others understand the
                                nature of the disease. If you have a chance to work with Jon, all I can say is: Do it.
